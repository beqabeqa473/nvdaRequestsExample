# nvdaRequestsExample
an example how to use requests module inside nvda

This addon uses requests module to retrieve information about ip address by selecting text containing an ip and pressing NVDA+shift+i.
This stands just for an example.
The only change made in requests itself was to change import http.cookies to be imported from local http package.
